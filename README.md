# ramp-control
Raspberry Pi Real-Time system controlling ramp lower and raise.

System consists of a servo motor and 3 LED (R,Y,G) simulating a semaphore. Servo controls ramp movement (rising on green, lowering on red). Servo is controlled by PWM click module. Ramp also has IR distance click sensor detecting objects under ramp and disabling ramp's movement avoiding potential collision.

Project is made as a part of exam grade from university subject Real-Time Programming.
